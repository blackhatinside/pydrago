I need a complete implementation of a Multi User (Pub-Sub type) collaborative diagramming tool (something like figma/excalidraw) using CRDT (use yjs) built on top of a front-end which was made using React Flow. I will share the JSON sample data with you so you can have an understanding of the structure of data which needs to be handled by our CRDT implementation. Basically multiple users should be able to work in this web app at the same time on the same diagram (need for concurrent and independent operations). Make sure the project code doesn't break when it's run. We will be building the project iteratively. You will help me create the necessary files and give me their code snippets, also make sure to store the absolute path of the files in the project in the form of a comment in the first line of the file itself. And when making changes to an existing file, I will update the files in your project knowledge. So make sure to look into those previously updated files in the project knowledge base, so as to not go into hallucination or assumptions about the content present in the file. And we will be building the project (named PyDraGo) in Django basically inside a python virtual environment (named MyEnv). So we also need a requirements file and a readme file to keep track of package installations and changes made to the project after every prompt given to you (claude). Since we are going to build the project in a incremental fashion, you can log the updates made into the readme file, so as to keep track of the changes and work on top of it after every prompt query I give you. Also, keep in mind that we are going to locally host the project, we don't have any paid cloud servers. So it's going to be a local Django application.



Files shared in Project Knowledge before starting the Project for Claude's Reference (NOTE: only read these files if you haven't read them in the previous prompts/queries given by me, or if you are reading this Project Instructions for the first time):

1. README_yjs.md                            # the README file from Yjs Github Repo
2. README_ypy.md                            # the README file from Ypy Github Repo
3. ypy-readthedocs-io-en-latest.pdf         # Python bindings to y-crdt
4. example_small.json                       # Sample JSON Test data used in the app currently (before we dediced to make it collaborative using CRDT)
5. datatypes.py                             # this auto-generated and optimized Model is successfully able to parse the JSON sample data
